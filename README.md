 I have completed all the basic requiremtes for this project

 I have implementd Extra Credit 1: [10pts] A return date should naturally come after a departure date, though the requirements above have not asked you to guarantee that. This can be done using either (or some combination of) HTML form attributes and JavaScript coding in the browser, Mongoose validation code, or some Express middleware validation. Here's an example of using express-validator middleware to check if two passwords match as an example of how this might be done.Links to an external site. If you add any of these (or better yet, multiple checks in the interface and at the backend) that will earn you 10 extra points.

 I have implementd Extra Credit 2:[25pts] It would be preferable that only an authenticated, logged-in user should be able to create a new vacation package and edit/delete an existing one. Any user—authenticated or not—should be able to view all the current vacation listings though. Update the interface such that only a logged-in user can access the edit/delete pages. Add some code that allows only logged-in users to create and edit the vacation descriptions and that will earn you extra credit.

 Apart from this I have also kept one more validation with Departure Date: i.e Departure date cannot be date before today's date
